<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Follow these steps in order to run ruby code.

### Prerequisites

First you need to ensure that you have ruby installed in your computer. 

### Install

It varies depending on your operating system so here are some links to help you install it on [Windows](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10) and on [Ubuntu](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#apt). 

For MacOS run the following commands

```sh
  brew install rbenv ruby-build
  # Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
  echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
  source ~/.bash_profile

  # Install Ruby
  rbenv install 3.0.1
  rbenv global 3.0.1
  ruby -v
```

This example shows how to install Ruby 3.0.1 which was the latest version in April 2021, but you can check to see if there is a newer version [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/). Iy is also assumed that you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) already installed on your Mac.

Next you'll want to intall Rails and postgreSQL by running the following commands, but you can also use any SQL application of your choice

```shell
  gem install rails -v 7.0.6

  sudo apt install postgresql libpq-dev
```

And start postgreSQL and the app with 

```shell
  sudo service postgresql start

  rails server
```

### Setup

Once you have ruby installed, run this command to get the project on your local machine.

```sh
  git clone git@github.com:jlvFlores/RoR-blog-app.git
```

### Usage

Once you have the project installed, access the project's root directory usign this command 

```sh
  cd RoR-blog-app
```

And lastly, run this command to see the project in in your browser.

```sh
  rails server
```
